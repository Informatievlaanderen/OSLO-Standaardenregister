This vocabulary makes it possible to describe public services, i.e. services provided by a 
public organisation for the benefit of individuals, companies or for other public organisations. 
The OSLO Service vocabulary is based entirely on the 
[ISA Core Public Service Vocabulary](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/core_public_service/description) and to the implicit 
extension of that vocabulary for the purpose of an [application profile for a service catalogue](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/cpsv-ap/asset_release/core-public-service-vocabulary-application-profile-v20).
No new terms have been added, the extension only consists of a translation of the terms into Dutch.
