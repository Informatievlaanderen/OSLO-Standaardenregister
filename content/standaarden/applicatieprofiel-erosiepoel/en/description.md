This OSLO trajectory focuses on measures that combat soil erosion, 
such as erosion pools. 
What follows are a number of use cases that fall under this:

- Reviewing the current state of an erosion control measure.
- To make predictions based on observations on the erosion control measures and 
  the zones that relate to this.
- Keeping track of what maintenance has been done on which erosion control measures.
- Describing where a certain sensor is located in relation to an erosion control measure. 
  This can be the case, for example, in the event that a sensor is at the entrance to an erosion pool. 
  This is important in order to correctly use the value of an observation by that sensor.

The application profile and vocabulary are called "Erosiepoel" but the OSLO route is called "Modderstroom Monitoring".
