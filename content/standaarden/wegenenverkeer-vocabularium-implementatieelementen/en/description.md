The MOW policy area focuses on data standards for the broad domain of roads and traffic. The Object Type Library (OTL) specifies an implementation model for the data exchange over the entire lifecycle of components and installations broadly related to roads and traffic as specified in the various Standard Specifications 250, 260 and 270. Based on an adapted process and method for this domain, vocabularies with corresponding code lists are created. These vocabularies form the basis for one master implementation model with which all data around road (appurtenances) can be exchanged as one data stream. This master implementation model is also offered in smaller implementation models focused on aspect.

The vocabularies, deployment models, and code lists are published on https://wegenenverkeer.data.vlaanderen.be.
