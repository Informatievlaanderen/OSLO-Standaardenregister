The OSLO Person application profile brings together terms from people vocabularies and mainly from the 
[OSLO-Person vocabulary](https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/persoon). 
In principle, an application profile has a particular application in mind and for that purpose 
imposed additional constraints such as cardinalities and prescribed code lists. That is not the case here and so 
we speak of a basic profile. 
It contains the information that is considered relevant within OSLO for the exchange of data about individuals. 
This does not alter the fact that the profile brings together terms that we mainly see in the context of a population register.
