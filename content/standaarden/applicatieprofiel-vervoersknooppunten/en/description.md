The aim of this process is to standardise the structure of data on Transport Hubs in consultation with all stakeholders. In order to semantically enrich data flows, to make transport hubs easier to find and understand, and to make this data easier to combine with other data sources. We build the vocabulary on the basis of international standards. We are bringing this in line with the applicable Flemish regulations.
