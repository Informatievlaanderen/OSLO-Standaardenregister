OSLO-Person focuses on describing a natural person, i.e. a physical person and not an organization. 
Natural persons have their own legal personality, which is not artificial as with legal persons. 
The vocabulary is an extension of existing RDF vocabularies about people. After all, they are merely intended to provide a 
person (e.g. the [ISA Core Person Vocabulary](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/42440) which models name, gender, date of birth, among other things) or 
are designed for specific applications (e.g. [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) which focuses mainly on person-to-person relationships).
