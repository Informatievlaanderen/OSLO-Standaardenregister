This document describes an application profile, in this case the Publication of the AP Decree. 
The application profile was developed within the project [Local Decisions as Linked Open Data](https://lokaalbestuur.vlaanderen.be/lokale-besluiten-als-gelinkte-open-data) 
and allows the minutes and 
decisions of an administrative body in a linked way, to preserve linked authenticity and to disclose linked data. 
It answers the question of how the corresponding domain model can be applied in practice. 
The restrictions (cardinality, code lists) are explained and the corresponding (RDF) terms are listed.
