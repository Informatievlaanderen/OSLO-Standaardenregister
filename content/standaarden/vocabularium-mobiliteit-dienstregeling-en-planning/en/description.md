Public transport in Flanders and Belgium is structured according to the offer (lines and stops), the medium and short-term planning of vehicles and drivers (respectively, runs and services), the communication of these to the general public (timetables and disruptions), and finally the real-time and historical execution of the planned journeys.

To date, all information on this subject is managed, distributed and communicated by De Lijn and its three co-public transport companies (SNCB, STIB, TEC) in various ad hoc or non-ad hoc data formats.

The European Union has commissioned the ITS project to structure all this information in the NeTEx format, giving each member state the opportunity to develop its own "profile" in which its specificities can be included. For Belgium, De Lijn has taken the lead in drawing up a profile specification, based on the EPIP substandard.

Since this information is an important building block within the domain of Flemish mobility, we want this specification to be created within the OSLO programme, with the emphasis on the openness and linkability of the information. The public reviews against which the specification is tested guarantee the usability and accessibility of the information for the Flemish public services and citizens' initiatives on structural mobility.

By going through the official OSLO process, we aim to obtain a vocabulary on structural mobility, and an application profile that shapes the EPIP implementation to be built on the basis of this vocabulary.
