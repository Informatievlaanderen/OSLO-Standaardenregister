The aim of this process is to standardise the structure of data on payroll data in consultation with all stakeholders. In order to semantically enrich data streams, to make wage data easier to find and understand, and to make this data easier to combine with other data sources. We build the vocabulary on the basis of international standards. We are bringing this in line with the applicable Flemish regulations. This is an initiative of the Agency for the Payment of the Growth Package, Digital Flanders and the Data Utility Company. Standardisation is done at the request of the various stakeholders within the sector.
