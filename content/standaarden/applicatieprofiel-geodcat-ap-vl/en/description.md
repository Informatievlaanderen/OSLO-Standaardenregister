The applications covered by this profile are catalogues of descriptions of geographical data that are created by transforming catalogues described according to the ISO (INSPIRE) agreements.

This application profile is a further refinement of the agreements made in the application profile metadata DCAT. And has as a sister application profile DCAT-AP Flanders for Open Data. 
With this application profile, we promote the uniformity of the available information about datasets and data services (metadata). This simplifies the aggregation process of multiple Open Data Catalogues to the Flemish, federal and European Open Data portal. 

As indicated, this application profile is not intended to replace the agreements made in the context of GDI Flanders. GeoDCAT-AP Flanders shows more specifically how these agreements are presented within GDI Flanders in the broad context of all dataset and dataservice descriptions. It therefore forms a bridge between both metadata worlds.
