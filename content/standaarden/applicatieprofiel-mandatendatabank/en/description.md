This document describes an application profile, in this case the AP Mandate Database. 
The application profile has been developed within the project [Local Decisions as Linked Open Data](http://lokaalbestuur.vlaanderen.be/lokale-besluiten-als-gelinkte-open-data) 
and allows to set up a linked mandate database based on linked decisions. It answers the question 
about how it 
corresponding domain model can be applied in practice. In doing so, the restrictions (cardinality, code lists)
and listed the corresponding (RDF) terms.
