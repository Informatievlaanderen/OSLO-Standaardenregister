This vocabulary was developed to describe information about notifications. A notification is a message from a 
sender to a recipient, with the aim of informing the recipient about a certain event or newsworthiness. 
This vocabulary reuses terms from [Schema.org](https://schema.org/), an initiative of Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, whenever possible, to 
Include structured data in web pages and emails, among other things. The intention to send a notification 
is expressed by the class InformAction([schema:InformAction](https://schema.org/InformAction)) and can be described by properties 
which provide information about the target group, content and relevance of the message, among other things.
