The applications covered by this profile are Open Data portals in Flanders. 
Open Data portals are catalogues of Open Data datasets. Their main objective is to make them findable 
and encourage its reuse. Open Data portals play a central role in the public task of 
facilitate access to reusable public sector information. With this application profile, we promote the uniformity of the 
available information about datasets (metadata). We also simplify the aggregation process of multiple 
Open Data Catalogues to the Flemish, federal and European Open Data portal. 
DCAT-AP Flanders is therefore a minimum requirement for Open Data catalogues in Flanders.
