This vocabulary was developed to describe information related to reports from citizens or organisations 
to the government. Reports can be about problems identified in the physical world, such as illegal dumping or a pit in the road, 
or digital problems such as errors and incompleteness in digital data sources. This vocabulary reuses terms and 
constructs from the [Web Annotation Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/) 
and [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) of [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).
