The OSLO Decision-Making application profile focuses on the terms that relate to information from 
formal decision-making procedures. In order to ensure an efficient exchange with all parties involved, 
facilitation, a more widely supported, common and explicit conceptual framework was drawn up. 
This application profile is therefore based on [OSLO Decision](https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/besluit/),
but also on [OSLO-Dossier](https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/dossier/), 
[OSLO-Generic](https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/generiek), 
[OSLO Organization](https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/organisatie)
 and the international W3C standard [Provenance Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) (PROV-O).
