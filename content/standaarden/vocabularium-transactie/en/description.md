This vocabulary is an extension of the [OSLO Service](http://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/dienst) vocabulary. 
It defines additional classes and attributes for describing public service in a transactional context, 
in other words, when a particular Agent (e.g. a natural person) consumes a particular public service, 
For example, applying for a new identity card.
In this vocabulary, terms are specified to document the status of the consumption of a public service, 
including properties that indicate whether action is required from the customer at a certain time to achieve the 
services.
Furthermore, terms were reused from the 
[ISA Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/core-criterion-and-core-evidence-vocabulary) to specify the dynamics between
criteria imposed in order to be able to use a particular Public Service and the answers and 
evidence provided by customers to substantiate that they meet these criteria.
