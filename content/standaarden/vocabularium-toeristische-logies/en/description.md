Through this initiative, governments in Flanders want to model and use accommodation data semantically as a first step. 
strive for a semantic standard: 'Tourist accommodation - basic'. 
The Tourist Vocabulary is brought in line with current (international) standards and enriched where relevant 
(Flemish initiatives and regulations).
Tourism Flanders (TVL) wishes to make its accommodation register semantically accessible as Linked Open Data. 
This initiative stems from the [Accommodation Decree] (https://www.toerismevlaanderen.be/logiesdecreet) and the 
[TVA decree](https://www.toerismevlaanderen.be/toerismevoorallen). The objective is that this core data is easily reused 
by all stakeholders.
This project is being realised in collaboration with Informatie Vlaanderen (AIV), which is responsible for TVL 
methodological support in the development of a standard and the AIV also acts as a quality assurance officer 
the tourism vocabulary is part of the system of Open Standards for Linking Governments (OSLO). 
All important stakeholders, private or government, who are directly or indirectly involved in accommodation are invited. 
This initiative is a first step, but the intention is to expand other tourism sub-domains in a future-oriented way 
standardize.
