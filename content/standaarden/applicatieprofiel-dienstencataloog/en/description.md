This is an application profile on the [OSLO Service Vocabulary](https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/dienst).
A profile basically merges terms from different RDF vocabularies with a view to a particular application 
(including restrictions and/or conditions such as cardinalities and code lists). 

For the OSLO Service vocabulary, however, we relied entirely on the vocabulary produced by ISA to make the 
[Core Public Service Application Profile](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/core-public-service-vocabulary-application-profile-v20). This is an application profile for describing a 
Service catalogue, more specifically a catalogue for public services. The OSLO Service application profile takes the 
ISA application profile over, i.e. the same constraints apply.
