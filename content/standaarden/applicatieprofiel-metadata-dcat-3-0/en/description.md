<section> <p>This OSLO project focuses on updating to <strong>DCAT 3.0</strong> for Flemish metadata about datasets and data services, so that descriptions are unambiguous, findable and exchangeable. We are tuning in to the European original version: <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCAT-AP 3.0 (SEMIC).</a></p> <p>What follows are a number of use cases that fall under this:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Unified description</strong> of datasets and data services in catalogs.</li> <li><strong>Linking</strong> between datasets, distributions, and APIs/data services according to DCAT-AP 3.0.</li> <li><strong>Consistent validation and exchange</strong> (harvesting and publishing) between catalogs.</li> <li><strong>Migration and mapping</strong> from DCAT-AP 2.0 to 3.0, with clear fields and rules.</li> <li><strong>Support for dataset series, licensing, access, and provenance</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Compliance with European obligations</strong> such as High Value Datasets.</li></ul> <p><strong>Stakeholder participation:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Webinar 1</strong>: scope and gap analysis 2.0â†’3.0; collecting needs and wishes.</li> <li><strong>Webinar 2</strong>: proposal of profiles and validation rules; migration paths; Alignment with the needs of stakeholders.</li></ul> <p> The final model is as close as possible to the needs and wishes of stakeholders.</p> </section>
