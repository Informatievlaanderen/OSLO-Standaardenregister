Almost every business process is supported by APIs that transfer information from one information system to another. In addition to semantic interoperability of the data that is exchanged, it is important to know how these APIs can be queried, what functionality they offer and how we can link to them.

The [Hypermedia API](https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/generieke-hypermedia-api) developed in 2018 (guiding for machines) already offers a number of standardized building blocks to make integration with APIs automatic, so that a machine can browse through an API like we humans follow the hyperlinks on web pages. In 2020, we wish to focus on the implementation of the developed building blocks in production APIs and the standardization of new building blocks, specifically with regard to authorization, authentication and the integration with Apigee of Het Facilitair Bedrijf. In addition, we are also committed to elevating the API Directive (Guiding for People) to a supported good practice of governments in Flanders.
