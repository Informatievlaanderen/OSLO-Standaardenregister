The management of statistical data is an important aspect within the OSLO Water Quality process, OSLO Statistics was therefore developed to describe statistical observations based on the need that arose from OSLO Water Quality. This allows to display averages, medians, quantiles, and other statistical measures, without having to list all the individual observations that contributed to these metrics.
