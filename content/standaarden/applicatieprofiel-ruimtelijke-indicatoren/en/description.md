The aim of this process is to standardize the structure of data on Spatial Indicators in consultation with all stakeholders. In order to semantically enrich data streams, to make data related to spatial indicators easier to find and understand, and to make this data easier to combine with other data sources. In this way, permanent insight can be gained into the use of space and the spatial structure of a neighbourhood.
