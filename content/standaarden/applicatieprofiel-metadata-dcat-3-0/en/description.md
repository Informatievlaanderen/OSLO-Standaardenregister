The digitization of the government ensures better, more correct and more efficient services to citizens and entrepreneurs. To support this growth in digital services, there is a need for an overview of the available information (datasets) and services (data services). Today, this information is provided in different forms and levels of quality, highly dependent on the technology and platform used to offer the datasets and data services. There is a need for an overview. The process focuses on descriptions of the data and data services from the perspective of the manager of an information system. The perspective of a service (such as issuing an identity card) to citizens or companies is out of scope. For this, we refer to the vocabulary Service and application profile Service Catalogue. In addition, the first step is to make datasets and data services accessible outside the domains of geographical information and open data; i.e. descriptions of datasets and data services in domains such as personal and organization-sensitive information. This is because semantic agreements already exist in the context of both the geographical data and data services (ISO/INSPIRE and OGC) and open data (OSLO application profile DCAT-AP Flanders). The objective is to make the new agreements integrable with the existing agreements for geographical data and open data.
