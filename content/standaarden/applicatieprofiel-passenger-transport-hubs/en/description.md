OSLO Passenger Transport Hubs is a project started by GreenMov in collaboration with Digital Flanders. 

<a href="https://green-mov.eu/">GreenMov</a> is a CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) project within the framework of 'The Green Deal'. This involves bringing together and making available data on mobility with the ultimate goal of achieving greener mobility. GreenMov and Digital Flanders are working together to harmonise datasets with regard to mobility, create integrated services and new cross-border functionalities by combining different datasets.

A 'passenger transport hub' is a transport hub for travellers. Depending on the location, you can offer various mobility services such as train, tram, bus, shared mobility, etc. retrieve. The aim of the transport hub is to facilitate multimodality: access to and connection between the various options for mobility. In Flanders, transport node pits are placed under the "Hoppin points" brand. A semantic Dutch model has already been created for this purpose and is in public review: <a href="https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/kandidaat-standaard/vocabularia-en-applicatieprofielen-hoppinpunten.html">OSLO Hoppin Points</a>. This Dutch route has served as the basis for the development of the OSLO Passenger Transport Hubs model.

Below you will find the application profile and the documents that led to the elaboration of the Passenger Transport Hubs model.
