The aim of this process is to standardize the structure of Linked Data Event Streams (LDES) in consultation with the stakeholders. This will make it possible to semantically enrich data streams, which simplifies synchronization with, and replication of, the LDES source data as well as makes it easier to combine with your own Linked Data Event Stream that is based on the LDES source data. The OSLO LDES standard forms the basis for the development of the 'Flemish Sensor Data Space' recovery project.
