This document describes a scalable process and the methodology for developing and modifying data 
standards, and managing the lifecycle of these standards. 
The process and methodology are based on international best practices from, among others, 
ISA1, W3C2 and OpenStand3. This process aims to build consensus between different 
public administrations, and the facilitation of semantic, syntactic and technical interoperability.
How this process can be set up is substantiated on the basis of a method, which describes a 
way of working to ensure clear communication and clear documentation throughout the process, 
so that the data can be implemented by default by all stakeholders such as project managers, 
business analysts, developers, etc.
