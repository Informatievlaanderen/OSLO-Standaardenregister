The aim of this process is to standardize the structure of data on everything within the Local Economy in consultation with all stakeholders. In order to semantically enrich data streams, to make data about the Local Economy easier to find and understand, and to make this data easier to combine with other data sources. We build the vocabulary on the basis of international standards. We are bringing this in line with the applicable Flemish regulations.
