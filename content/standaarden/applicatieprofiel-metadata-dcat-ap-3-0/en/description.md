<p>This OSLO project focuses on updating metadata DCAT-AP (the Flemish application profile for metadata on datasets and data services) to version 3.0 and explicitly aligns it with both <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/">W3C DCAT 3.0</a> and the European application profile <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/">DCAT-AP 3.0 (SEMIC),</a> so that descriptions are unambiguous, findable and interchangeable.</p>
 <p>What follows are a number of use cases that fall under this:</p> 
 <ul> 
   <li><strong>Unified description</strong> of datasets and data services in catalogs.</li> <li><strong>Linking</strong> between datasets, distributions, and APIs/data services according to DCAT-AP 3.0.</li> 
   <li><strong>Consistent validation and exchange</strong> (harvesting and publishing) between catalogs.</li>
   <li><strong>Migration and mapping</strong> from DCAT-AP 2.0 to 3.0, with clear fields and rules.</li> 
   <li><strong>Support for dataset series, licensing, access, and provenance</strong>.</li>
   <li><strong>Compliance with European obligations</strong> such as High Value Datasets.</li> 
 </ul>
