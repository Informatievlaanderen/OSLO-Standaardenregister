This document describes a vocabulary, in this case the Administrative Sanctions Register Vocabulary. This Vocabulary was developed in the context of the Framework Decree on Administrative Enforcement (2019), which provides for the development of an information system to collect administrative sanctions, so that this information can be consulted by different organisations and services, across the different levels of government. The vocabulary specifies a number of classes and properties to describe an administrative sanction.
