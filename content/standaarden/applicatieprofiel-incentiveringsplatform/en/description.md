This project proposal includes the incentive of (socially) desired behaviour via (digital) coins, points or other forms of reward. Then also increasing participation by allowing citizens, employees, students, among others, to participate in valuable actions. In addition, the local economy is stimulated by promoting more spending in their own region. Finally, there is also the development of a mechanism to allow the (digital) coins, points or other forms of reward to circulate as much as possible within the community.
