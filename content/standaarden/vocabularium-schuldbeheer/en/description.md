The "Debt Management" vocabulary aims to standardize the information on "Unity of Debt" and to develop a common understanding of essential information. This application profile has been developed within the GZG (Municipality-without-townhall) Boost trajectory, together with Lokaal Digitaal, specifically for the local government of Ghent. It aims to create a common language and understanding of the concept of 'unity of blame' between suppliers and local authorities, which often communicate differently.
The OSLO trajectory focused on defining concepts and establishing the right relationships to make this understanding operational. The ultimate goal is to create an additional collection process for financial directors.  
This vocabulary provides a framework for collecting and sharing relevant data with third parties.
