The OSLO Organization application profile is a profile on existing vocabulary regarding organizations including the 
[OSLO Organization Vocabulary](http://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/organisatie).

Normally, an application profile brings together terms needed for a particular application 
(incl. additional constraints such as cardinalities and code lists). In this case, however, we did not have a particular 
application, i.e. a basic profile. It indicates which terms within OSLO are considered relevant for 
exchanging information about organizations.
