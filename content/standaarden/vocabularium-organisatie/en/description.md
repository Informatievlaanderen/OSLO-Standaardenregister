OSLO Organization adds terms to three existing vocabularies that describe organizations: 
[W3C Organiszation Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#org:Organization); 
[W3C Registering Organization Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-regorg/); and 
[ISA Core Public Organization Vocabulary](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/cpov/home).
The main additions are subclasses to take a closer look at the changes that organizations undergo during their life course 
(i.e. incorporation, merger, demerger, discontinuance and change).
