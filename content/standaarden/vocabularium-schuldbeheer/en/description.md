The vocabulary "Debt Management" aims to standardize the information on "Unity of Debt" and to develop a common understanding of essential information. This application profile was developed within the GZG (Municipality-without-town hall) Boost project, together with Local Digital, specifically for the local government of Ghent. It aims to create a common language and understanding of the concept of 'unity of debt' between suppliers and local authorities, who often communicate differently.
The OSLO track focused on defining concepts and establishing the right relationships to make this understanding operational. The ultimate goal is to realize an additional collection process for financial directors.
