Through this initiative, the various stakeholders within the cultural heritage sector wish to 
semantically model different data streams related to the (digital) collections and to use the 
structure of the data. 
The vocabulary is built on the basis of international standards in which the cultural heritage sector 
a broad consensus exists and is brought into line with current Flemish regulations.
This specific implementation model offers organizations formal agreements on the basic registration of objects and events that apply to them.
