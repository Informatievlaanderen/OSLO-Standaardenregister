This OSLO programme focuses on assistance and services to detainees and the questions that can be asked about this. 
It is important to have information about the various activities and 
the prisons and detention houses where they take place. 
How these activities are achieved is also important. 
To this end, we also keep information about which organizations organize the activities and 
what funding these organisations receive.
