The GIS business parks is a Flemish authentic geographical data source managed by 
the Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The dataset includes two major entities, namely Parcels and Sites. 
Plots are usable plots with information about buildings, function, use and availability supplemented with 
different types of constraints according to development and activation potential. Terrains, in turn, are the contours 
of business parks through the phases of planning – development – realization and management.
Through this initiative, governments in Flanders want to model and use the business parks semantically as a first step. 
strive for a semantic standard: 'Business parks'. . The objective is that this standard can be easily reused 
by all stakeholders. This project is being realised in collaboration with Informatie Vlaanderen (AIV), which 
stakeholders in the development of a standard and also acts as a quality controller 
points out that the parcel standard is part of the system of Open Standards for Linking Governments (OSLO).
