This project proposal includes the incentive of (socially) desired behaviour through (digital) coins, points or other forms of remuneration. Subsequently, increasing participation by, among other things, allowing citizens, employees and students to participate in valuable actions. In addition, the local economy is stimulated by promoting more spending in their own region. Finally, there is also the development of a mechanism to circulate the (digital) coins, points or other forms of reward within the community as much as possible.
