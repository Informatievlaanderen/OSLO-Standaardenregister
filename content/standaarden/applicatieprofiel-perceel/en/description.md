In Flanders, Information Flanders and the General Administration for Heritage Documentation (AAPD) are working on one authentic source for parcel information (unique parcel plan). Within this source, each private/owned plot in Flanders is uniquely identified and 
characterized by a geometric representation, (usable in a scale range of 1/250 â€“ 1/5000 OR in line with the 
recommendations in the INSPIRE data specifications for cadastral parcels (link)). The AAPD fulfills the role of manager of 
this source and implements it according to the principles agreed with Informatie Vlaanderen and users of 
parcel information in Flanders. The data in this source are distributed under different product forms (Administrative Plot (ADP) in the Base Map Flanders (GRB), cadastral plots (CaPa) in the cadastral plot plan (CADGIS), ...).
Through this initiative, governments in Flanders, in collaboration with the 
General Administration for Patrimonial Documentation (AAPD) to model parcel information in Flanders semantically . 
The resulting standard 'plots' must be able to be easily reused by all stakeholders.
