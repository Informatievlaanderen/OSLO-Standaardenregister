Within this OSLO Quality Roads and Road Markings process, the intention is to draw up an implementation model that will provide the basis for facilitating a general approach to information from different sensors regarding quality aspects of the roads, pavement and road markings. This standard is built up on the basis of international standards and enriched with its own specialized terms.
