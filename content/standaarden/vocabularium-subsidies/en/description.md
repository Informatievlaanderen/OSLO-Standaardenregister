Much of the information about subsidies can be found in the decisions drawn up by local authorities. 
In the context of LBLOD (local decisions as linked open data), the Agency for Domestic Governance is committed to the 
decentralised collection of this data. During this process, we focus on subsidy regulations and awards. 
This application profile will therefore be based on OSLO Decree Publication, but also on OSLO Service Catalogue, 
OSLO Service Transaction Model and OSLO Subsidy Register.
