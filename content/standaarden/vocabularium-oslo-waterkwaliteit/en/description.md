This project tries to standardize the structure of water quality in consultation with all stakeholders. This process started from ODALA Air & Water, whereby the aspect of water quality was cast in a Dutch standard during this process. This will make it possible to semantically enrich data streams within Flanders, which will make water quality data easier to find and understand, as well as easier to combine with other data sources.
