The digital water meters will be rolled out in Flanders by 2030. Consumption is a
important element in the data flow. This knowledge is useful for the drinking water company in question,
but also for other stakeholders such as cities and municipalities or research institutions. The
However, data flow is not clearly defined for the various drinking water companies, and
no account of the GDPR yet. In this context, the data flow must be semantically modelled
with a standardized structure.

The objective is to unlock the data as Linked (Open) Data and standard interfaces (APIs)
to facilitate collaboration and integration of the various services and tools.

research.

Rather than providing ad-hoc data, De Watergroep, in collaboration with Farys, PIDPA and
Water-link to go several steps further by anonymizing data according to a linked data
model in the water data space. Standardised anonymisation should be
comply with GDPR regulations.

A proof-of-concept is being developed for the use of the data from the data space in a PIO
Waterdata route. The provided application uses aggregated, anonymized
consumption data, together with additional available information to monitor water consumption in the near
future and subsequently to be able to tailor the offer. A linked data
model makes the combined use of different data sources easier and
transferable. In this water data project, there are three important pillars:

1. The PIP process, in which a consumption forecast model is developed.
2. The OSLO trajectory, in which a data model is defined.
3. The onboarding process of digital water meter data on the Flemish Smart Data Space.
