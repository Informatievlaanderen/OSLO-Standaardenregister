The OSLO Address vocabulary adds terms to existing RDF vocabularies so that structured addresses can be 
exchanged. A European standard for such addresses exists ([INSPIRE-Address](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/Data_Specifications/INSPIRE_DataSpecification_AD_v3.0.pdf)) but has 
currently no RDF vocabulary. In addition, this standard is intended to describe any European address,
 in other words, it is too generic for the exchange of Belgian addresses. 
 However, we made sure that OSLO-Address maps perfectly to INSPIRE-Address.
