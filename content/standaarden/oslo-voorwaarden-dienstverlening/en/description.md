The OSLO Publication process 'Conditions of Service' should help to easily determine whether a person is entitled or must comply with a certain public service. Based on international standards, this standard is built up and enriched with its own initialized terms.
This process was discontinued in consultation with the stakeholders in order to allow for further research into structured conditions. This standard is currently in the status as it was developed after the last thematic working group. In other words, there is no approval of this standard.
