This document describes an application profile, in this case the Administrative Sanction Register of the AP. The application profile was developed in the context of the Framework Decree on Administrative Enforcement (2019), which provides for the development of an information system to collect administrative sanctions, so that this information can be consulted by different organisations and services, across the different levels of government. It answers the question of how the corresponding domain model can be applied in practice. The restrictions (cardinality, code lists) are explained and the corresponding (RDF) terms are listed.
